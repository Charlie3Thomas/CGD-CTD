Barycentric coordinates surface level research

    Barycentric coordinates are a mathematical representation of the position of a point within a triangle.
    They express a point inside the triangle as a combination of weights or proportions associated with it's vertices.

    If there is a triangle, with vertices A, B and C:
        Any point P within the triangle can be expressed as a linear combination of the three vertices, using proportions denoted as u, v, weighted
    
        P = u*A + v*B + w*CT

        u, v and w satisfy the following conditions:
            u + v + w == 1: or the point does not lie within the triangle
            0 <= u,v,w <=1: each weight is within the range of 0 -> 1
