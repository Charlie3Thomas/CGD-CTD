Shading frames surface level research:

    In the context of RT, shading frames/bases refer to local coordinate systems established on surfaces to facilitate shading calculations.
    
    When a ray intersects a surface, the shading frame is established at that point.
    
    It consists of three vectors:
        -surface normal
        -tangent vector
        -bitangent vector (cross product of surface normal and tangent)
    
    Surface normal:
        Vector perpendicular to the surface at the intersection point
    
    Tangent vector:
        The tangent vector lies on the plane of the surface, and is perpendicular to the surface normal.
        It represents the direction of increasing horizontal texture coordinates on the surface.
    
    Bitangent vector:
        The bitangent vector (binormal/cross product of normal&tangent vector) is perpendicular to both the surface normal and tangent vector
        The bitangent vector determins the direction of increasing vertical texture coordinates on the surface.
